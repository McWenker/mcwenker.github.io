						<p class="event-desc-text">Mr Sun comprises 3 generations of some of the sharpest minds to apply themselves to the American String Band repertoire. Legendary fiddler Darol Anger is at home in a number of musical genres, some of which he helped to invent, and is a member of the original "nuclear" generation of pickers who extended Bluegrass, Jazz, and Classical music to find their common ground; Mr Sun is the latest iteration in that legacy. Joe K. Walsh is one of the foremost contemporary mandolinists, with 4 award-winning years in the Gibson Brothers 2 solo recordings, and a Berklee professorship. Grant Gordy is a standout in the crowded field of Acoustic Guitar Wunderkinds. Grant's work was quickly recognized for its kaleidoscopic excellence and startling emotion, fusing Jazz and Bluegrass concepts to an unprecedented degree. The group recently added the spectacular young bassist Ethan Jodziewicz, who just concluded studies at Curtis Institute with Edgar Meyer. Ethan is one of the most virtuosic and versatile bassists anywhere, and is now helping to revolutionize the bass' role in American String Music.<br />

Besides living in Cuba during his formative years, Osmany has also lived in Mexico and Boston where he has been a vital part of the jazz scenes, including a faculty stint at the Berklee Music School. Osman currently resides in New York where he is a much sought after performer. Paredes is steeped in the European classical tradition as well as his native Cuba's traditional popular music. If you liked the groove of Rueben Gonzalez of Buena Vista Social fame, you'll love Osmany's playing. Viva Cuba y jazz!<br />

						<p class="event-desc-date">Wednesday, June 15</p>
						<p class="event-desc-text">By now you may have detected a slight personal bias on my part for the violin (aka fiddle). Well, I confess to that, but I'm not blind (er, deaf) to the glorious sound of other voices.  In fact, I think my favorite instrument for solo performance may be the cello (with the exception of the Bach solo violin)! And to prove it, I have the great pleasure of announcing this solo appearance by Astrid Schween, the new cellist of the Juilliard String Quartet.  I will be posting her program as soon as I get it, but I'm led to believe it will be quite eclectic.  The cello seems to have been experiencing a resurgence as a popular band instrument thanks to players like Matt Haimovitz, Edgar Meyer, Natalie Haas, and, of course, Yo Yo Ma.  Astrid is certainly part of this wave of cello popularizers while also maintaining the status of the instrument as a keystone of the classical quartet sound. If you haven't been to the chapel to hear just how lovely a cello can sound, here's your chance to hear it made by one of the great players of our time! I just gave myself goosebumps thinking how it's going to sound!<br />

						<p class="event-desc-date">Wednesday, July 27</p>
						<p class="event-desc-text">And now for Watermelon Wednesdays' first maybe annual mini-Americana-Roots-Bluegrass festival! The string and vocal trio Low Lily (formerly Annalivia) explores the roots and branches of American folk music with traditional influences and modern inspiration that weaves together a unique brand of acoustic music. Liz Simmons (vocals and guitar), Flynn Cohen (vocals, guitar, and mandolin), and Lissa Schneckenburger (vocals and fiddle) are masterful players with deep relationships to traditional music styles ranging from bluegrass to Irish, Scottish, New England, and Old Time Appalachian sounds. Twisted Pine has performed with bluegrass luminaries such as Peter Rowan, Gibson Brothers, and has been showcased as Berklee College of Music's premier acoustic act. Twisted Pine has performed on the main stages of major festivals such as Greyfox Bluegrass Festival, Celtic Connections in Glasgow, Green River Festival, FreshGrass Festival, Joe Val Bluegrass Festival, Thomas Point Beach Bluegrass Festival, and more. In 2014 they won both the FreshGrass and Thomas Point Beach band competitions and received an Iguana Music Fund Grant from Club Passim. They were nominated for the 2015 IBMA Band Performance Momentum Award and placed second in the 2015 RockyGrass band competition tie-breaking round.<br />

						<p class="event-desc-text">Jay and Molly are the finale of this year's season. It's been over 25 years since I took music classes with them both at their amazing and inspirational camp, Ashokan. Jay and Molly have done more than anyone I know to advance and spread the love and joy of traditional American music. They are truly a national cultural treasure.<br />
