					<td><strong><a href="http://darolanger.com/index.php?page=about&amp;family=projects&amp;display=147">Mister Sun </a>: Mr Sun comprises 3 generations of some of the sharpest minds to apply themselves to the American String Band repertoire. Legendary fiddler Darol Anger is at home in a number of musical genres, some of which he helped to invent, and is a member of the original "nuclear" generation of pickers who extended Bluegrass, Jazz, and Classical music to find their common ground; Mr Sun is the latest iteration in that legacy. Joe K. Walsh is one of the foremost contemporary mandolinists, with 4 award-winning years in the Gibson Brothers 2 solo recordings, and a Berklee professorship. Grant Gordy is a standout in the crowded field of Acoustic Guitar Wunderkinds. Grant's work was quickly recognized for its kaleidoscopic excellence and startling emotion, fusing Jazz and Bluegrass concepts to an unprecedented degree. The group recently added the spectacular young bassist Ethan Jodziewicz, who just concluded studies at Curtis Institute with Edgar Meyer. Ethan is one of the most virtuosic and versatile bassists anywhere, and is now helping to revolutionize the bass' role in American String Music. </strong><strong><em><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mister-sun-tickets-25129485969">Buy Tix Here!</a></em></strong></td>

If you haven't been to the chapel to hear just how lovely a cello can sound, here's your chance to hear it made by one of the great players of our time!

The string and vocal trio Low Lily (formerly Annalivia) explores the roots and branches of American folk music with traditional influences and modern inspiration that weaves together a unique brand of acoustic music. Liz Simmons (vocals and guitar), Flynn Cohen (vocals, guitar, and mandolin), and Lissa Schneckenburger (vocals and fiddle) are masterful players with deep relationships to traditional music styles ranging from bluegrass to Irish, Scottish, New England, and Old Time Appalachian sounds. Twisted Pine has performed with bluegrass luminaries such as Peter Rowan, Gibson Brothers, and has been showcased as Berklee College of Music's premier acoustic act. Twisted Pine has performed on the main stages of major festivals such as Greyfox Bluegrass Festival, Celtic Connections in Glasgow, Green River Festival, FreshGrass Festival, Joe Val Bluegrass Festival, Thomas Point Beach Bluegrass Festival, and more. In 2014 they won both the FreshGrass and Thomas Point Beach band competitions and received an Iguana Music Fund Grant from Club Passim. They were nominated for the 2015 IBMA Band Performance Momentum Award and placed second in the 2015 RockyGrass band competition tie-breaking round. <em> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/twisted-pine-low-lily-tickets-25181022115"> Buy Tix Here! </a></em></strong></td>
