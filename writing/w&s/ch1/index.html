						<h2><a href="#">The Rider in the Snow</a></h2>
					</div>
				</header>
				<!--- CONTENT HERE YO -->
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blizzard winds tore furiously at the rider’s cloak as she reached the gates of Steamhearth. Her horse, exhausted from the climb, moved slowly--deliberately--across the packed snow. Dozens of footprints, of man and beast alike, traced their ways towards the gateway in a funnel-like shape. Steam - colder than that rumored to be within the settlement’s namesake caverns - wisped from the nostrils of rider and beast alike, and vanished into the growing snow like children in the woods. There was an crossbow trained upon the rider.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbeknownst to her, the guards of the settlement were on high alert. Rumors of bandits lurking in the nearby mountains had torn through Steamhearth in the days prior, and unfounded tales of their bloodshed had brought fear and vindication into the hearts of the inhabitants. Knownst to her, the crossbow would likely miss in the wind and snow; she remained calm and continued allowing the guards to think she had not noticed the weapon aimed at her, her hood kept low over brow. As she reached the foot of the palisade she could see the cracked sap sealing its timbers, and at least a few axe-scars.</</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who goes there?” cried a guard above. The wind stole much of his hoarse question.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They call me Talina, of Miramar,” replied the rider.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You’re a long way from home, islander,” said the guard. “What is your business in Steamhearth?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina smirked. “As you’ve noticed, I’m a long way from my sun-blessed home. I seek refuge from the coming storm, and I’ve heard Steamhearth is a nice place to spend the winter.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the guard detected her sarcasm, he did not respond to it. “Who is your master, Hemosi? Where is he, and why has he allowed you to depart the westerlands?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina grit her teeth, and sighed deeply. She could not allow the ignorance of some Quosh gatekeeper to break her patience. Not yet, at least. “Look upon my hands,” she replied. “I have no master, ser. Now may I enter your settlement?”</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long period of silence, perhaps a minute or more. The crossbow remained in its ominous perch over the palisade, but Talina retained her feigned ignorance. The gates did not open, however the sally-port did. A stocky man, dressed in thick furs over chainmail and leather, came out the port before it closed behind him. His face was square--and humble, his nose broken at least one time. Several shaving cuts pockmarked his reddened cheeks. His helmet was tucked under one arm, and a woolen cap tooks its place atop his head. His other hand rested atop a sword at his waist.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina sized the man up before her and her horse. Whether foolish or brave, the man came out alone to confront a mounted stranger, which was certainly worth remembering. His pose seemed restive, but she noticed his gloved hands gripping and un-gripping the pommel of his sword uneasily.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Maryk,” said the man. “I’m the captain of the guard here.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Pleasure,” replied Talina.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you would be so kind as to dismount your steed,” said the man, gripping his pommel once more.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Pleasure,” repeated Talina.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And, kindly, remove your hood.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina complied with a faint smile. Her grey hair fell near to her shoulders, in coiling braids as was once traditional among her people. The cold gnawed at her ears greedily, like a dog at a grizzled bone.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We’ve had a number of bandit stories in our settlement of late. Numerous traders, people we expected to come before this storm, have disappeared, their caravans armed. We haven’t had a visitor to Steamhearth in near a month, and I fear many of our usual guests are dead or captured. Now, I don’t mean any discourtesy, but I find it very suspicious that a lone rider, a stranger and a Hemosi freefolk at that, comes riding to our settlement at ni--”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ser Maryk,” interrupted Talina, “if I had encountered your bandits upon the road, I would not have come riding to your settlement at night. I would like not be alive at all.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a lie, and perhaps an unnecessary one, but Talina did not want to take any chances as the blizzard drew nearer.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mayhaps that’s so,” said Maryk with another grip of the sword, “but still I must ask you: do you come to Steamhearth as a friend, or foe?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina noticed a second crossbow now hanging above the splintered palisade. She figured their chances were still low, but there was a tension building that could not be ignored. Maryk stared at her, hard, and she met his gaze with resolve.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A friend, of course. One wishing to use your hot springs on my long journey to Savinar.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mention of the cosmopolitan city-state registered an unidentifiable look on the face of the captain. Talina hoped she hadn’t ruined her chance with the name drop.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Then I ask you, friend, most respectfully,” Talina sensed a suspicion--or hostility--in his tone, “to reveal and remove any and all weapons you have brought on your journey.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Pleasure,” Talina echoed. She was confident she could handle the captain with or without her arsenal of material weaponry.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina forfeited the concealed sabres under her saddle-furs, and gave them to the guard. A dagger, longbow, and several trap-kits were handed over as well. She kept the silvered dagger hidden within her boot, not willing to give up its security. Maryk seemed pleased by her cooperation, his hints of restiveness now commanding his demeanor. His hand had--at last--left the pommel of his blade. The snow had become a floating blanket of white.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Now, I must ask, Talina of Miramar,“ he said when the last trap-kit was placed into a rucksack he had produced, “that you pay the tariff required for entry.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Quosh’ari and their taxes,</em> she thought. <em>Might have to hold on to enough for the exit tariff, too.</em></p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached into her coin purse, and dropped three silver Syrnian crosses into Maryk’s gloved palm. It was much more than any entry tariff this far south, but Maryk’s grimace showed he understood the gesture.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Welcome to Steamhearth,” he said, holding the frigid smile. “Open it up, lads!”</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden gates creaked noisily as the guards pulled it open. Within the settlement, torches outside of the three stone buildings flickered weakly in the blizzard winds. A number of shoddy wooden structures--if one could even call them such--leaned against the brick structures, and heavily-clothed folk huddled around larger fires before the shambles or peeked out at the commotion from behind rotten timbers. Beside the largest stone-worked building, in the center of the settlement, steam billowed out from the cave entrance. Talina knew that a fair number of Steamhearth’s inhabitants lived within its legendary steam tunnels, but she still estimated the total population at no more than fifty.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow had been pushed out of a central square between buildings, and piled high against the interior of the palisades. Some of it sat in barrels before the cavern, likely used to fuel the steam endlessly billowing forth from the mouth of the cavern like the maw of some slumbering dragon. As the gates groaned shut behind the pair, a number of residents were making their way across the square.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I trust I will have my belongings returned to me upon my departure?” asked Talina.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course,” replied the captain. “Assuming you mind your behaviour and don’t cause any trouble.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A Hemosi, deep in the Quosh’ari heartland,” said Talina with a wry smirk, “I can’t imagine what sort of trouble could occur.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if on cue, one of the residents cried nasally. Talina suspected ice-fever.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Just what do you think you’re doing, Maryk!?” he whined, “You’re welcoming one of those damnable bandits right into the town! Do you wish us damnation?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Calm yourself, Yorvel,” replied Maryk, his tone betraying the frequency of Yorvel’s whining. “This is Talina of Miramar, a pilgrim bound for Savinar, and she has obeyed the laws of this Dominion. I will not cast an innocent out to die in the snow.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“She’s a slave-kin!” cried another villager, shorter and far heavier than Yorvel. “Without her master at that. Nothing but trouble will come of her presence. What happens when the Syrnian slavers come knocking at the gates?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina’s teeth ground tightly, her jaw cracked. “Slave-kin” made her blood boil, but she could not afford a lost temper. Nor could Steamhearth. She pulled back her silken sleeves, revealing the deep purple flesh devoid of branding.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am no slave, sers. You have no trouble nor damnation to fear from me.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men stood before a small collection of residents, about ten in all, that shared a look of shock and revulsion as Talina spoke. She expected they had never met a freefolk before. Bigoted countryfolk, she thought - and smartly did not say. I’m wise to have held onto that dagger, I’d bet.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Maryk, this is folly!” protested a woman within the crowd, as the captain and Talina strode past. “She will kill us all in our--”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will hear no more of it!” bellowed Ser Maryk. “This woman has followed the laws, surrendered her weaponry, and paid her dues. She is a welcome guest in Steamhearth, and anyone who wishes to deny her that right will answer to me. Is that understood?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowdsfolk, their bigoted worries drained like air from a balloon, slowly dispersed back to their shanties. Yet Talina noticed the unpleasant stares of more than one of the guards standing by the gate. Their eyes did not leave her, even as she met them boldly. Wise indeed, she thought as she stared into the eyes of a blonde-bearded man leaning upon the gate. Hardened eyes; he was more a soldier than any other here, even Maryk. Talina knew - all too well - what kind of intolerances a life of bloodshed could breed.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maryk led her to the nearest of the three stonework structures. A handcarved wooden sign, hardly legible in the whirling snow, depicted some kind of filigree upon it. The words “Poryl’s Pantry” had been painted more than a few times, and the freshest coat was now peeling. A warmth billowed from the place, indicated by smaller tendrils of steam that wisped and faded  through cracks in the door.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is the closest thing we have to an inn, in Steamhearth,” said Maryk before the door. “Lest you want to sleep in the steam tunnels. Maybe you do, Hemosi, and that’s your perogative. Either way, you’ll want to meet Poryl. Mind your tongue, or he’s like to snatch it out and make a potion from it.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I expect I’ll like this fellow,Talina thought as the door squealed open.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth within the building was luxurious. Talina could not remember the last time she could actually consider herself ‘warm’ - as the guard on the palisade noted, she was a long way from the jungles of Miramar. If she was at home in the frigid heights, the mountains were unforgiving even to natives. The place was illuminated by a plethora of candles, oil lamps, and a roaring fire in a brick hearth. Beside the hearth was a long stone counter - of the same brick - laden with pottery, dinnerware, candlesticks, tools, and a few sacks of food. Behind the counter sat a man, his back to the pair. He appeared to be fervently concentrated on something, though Talina could not see what. His black hair was long, reaching to the floor, and braided in ceremonial Quosh’ari fashion. He did not react to their entry.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Poryl,” said Maryk. “I want to introduce you to someone.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not respond. Maryk turned to Talina with a look of exasperation.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Excuse me, ser,” said the Hemosi. Nothing.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Poryl!” repeated Maryk with a shout. The man leapt from his chair.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some sort of metal device clattered on the desk before the man, and appeared to fall to pieces. The man turned, his pink flesh dabbled with red rage.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Gods be damned, Maryk, can’t you see I’m busy?!” he shouted.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His appearance was largely concealed by a long beard, and thick spectacles gave his eyes the appearance of being many times too large for his face. He wore a linen nightgown, patched some dozen times. Despite its wear, the brilliant purple luster remained - and betrayed its extravagant value. The man eyed the pair crazily, his oversized eyes darting around like bloated fish in a tiny pond.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ahh, I see, a night-skin from the western jungles. Surprised to see you here in the heart of winter,” he said. He uttered the slur with such a harmlessness that Talina remained unoffended.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I come with a purpose, ser,” she replied.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Please, I am no ser,” said Poryl. “Nor is Captain Maryk here, truth be told. No, I’m sure there isn’t a sermurai within 200 leagues, lucky for you.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Erm, Talina is seeking passage to Savinar,” said the captain, who was no ser. “I figured she’d like to lodge upstairs. Or at the least, meet the only other person in this town that has met a freefolk before. The only person that’s seen the city firsthand.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ohh, Savinar, yes… great city, if you have a heavy coinpurse. And a tight grip on it. I have not been in some… has it been that long? Yes, I suppose… some ten years. But I’m sure the Merchant Council remains the same, and the city the same because of it. Seeking freedom from those western brutes, I assume?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Something to that effect,” Talina grinned. “Seeking many a few things from those brutes.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ho!” laughed the eccentric Poryl, “I like this one, Maryk. Any enemy of Syrn is a friend of mine. Yes, you’re welcome to stay in my dormitory upstairs, if you’d like. I’m assuming you’d like a stay in the steam baths, first, of course?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ve heard the many tales, and it would be nice to confirm them myself.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I assure you, m’lady, they are not merely tales!” said Poryl with a braggart’s flair.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, I’m glad to have introduced you two,” said Maryk. “I’ll be taking my leave now. Miss Talina, if you need any assistance, with the townsfolk or otherwise, do let me know. I meant what I said, Hemosi. You are welcome here, regardless of the ignorance of my charges.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you most kindly, Ser Maryk. I wish you a moonlit evening.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain seemed unsure how to respond to her ancestral blessing, and smiled sheepishly. Talina decided she liked the red-faced captain more than she initially thought, and hoped she wouldn’t need to trouble him with assisting her.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your belongings will be safe up here,” said Poryl in the dormitory.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was long, with the vaulted roof common in winter lodgings. A dozen hay-filled cots lined the walls, each with their own footlocker, and Talina was surprised to find her bed actually comfortable. The dorm inherited the dry warmth of the downstairs hearth, and Talina was grateful for it. Despite the number of cots available, not a single other person’s belongings were visible anywhere, and Talina assumed that was due to both the winter and the bandits. She wasn’t going to complain about the solitude.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nobody comes up here without my knowledge, nor my permission,” Poryl continued, “and if they try, they regret it. You’re welcome here as long as you need, but I would guess someone like you is trying to head out as soon as the blizzard’s passed.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You guess right,” replied Talina. “I cannot thank you enough. Surely you will accept payment for your kindness?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Want? Yes. Accept? No. Not from one such as yourself,” said Poryl.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Such as myself?” This time, Talina felt offended.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, one with a fire in their eye and their heart,” said the Quosh’ari. “Whatever your hope is in Savinar, you will need the money more there than here. I am more than willing to help you make it there wealthy and healthy.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina smiled. She found herself surprised by the kindness--and intuitions--of the man.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There are towels in your footlocker, and a bowl for washing,” said Poryl - with a hint of rehearsed boredom - as he turned to leave. “Let me know if you need anything else. There will be food in the morning, hopefully you can fend for yourself this evening.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you, ser.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man chuckled heartily as he descended the stairs.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam baths were better than even the stories. The hot springs were far warmer than even the jungles of Miramar, and Talina could have happily melted in them. The steam was heavy in the lower chambers were the baths had been dug-out, thickened by a near-constant supply of snow being dumped into the springs to melt. The torches struggled to stay alight in the dense humidity, and the room was nearly pitch-dark. Talina was not complaining. Nor was she complaining about the emptiness of the caves this late in the evening. Nudity was common in Hemos, but Talina could not help but feel embarrassed about the mere idea of baring her dark flesh in front of Quosh’ari. So the solitude was--once again--appreciated. Her fur-lined winter clothes--bought some five-hundred miles before the first time she ever saw snow--were piled in a messy lump against the cavern wall. Her silvered dagger remained nearer to her, despite the obvious tarnishing it would endure from all the damp, mineral-rich air.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking deep into the water, Talina closed her eyes and felt the warmth wash over her head. It had been too long since her last bath, she was surprised her hair remained in its braids so long without dreading. As the water heated her eyelids, Talina said a prayer to the moon-father. Ergor, bring me a moonlit life. Bring me freedom for my family, my friends. Bring me the strength to deliver them justice. Bring me the will to wage war for my people.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clattering sound that jolted Talina from her trance was audible even underwater. Reaching from the bath to grab her dagger, she slunk deep into the depths and half-swam to the far end of the chamber.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peering through the thick fog and darkness, Talina saw two men standing in the entrance to the chamber. Both men were armored, and held swords in their gloved hands. Talina recognized one of them as the blonde man from before, although his Quosh tabard had been removed. They walked along the edge of the bath, seemingly oblivious to Talina’s presence. The beared man knelt by her clothing for a moment, and rose again, peering across the large bathchamber.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“She’s in here,” he said, not quietly enough.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men split up, circling the baths like a pair of wolves. Talina’s heart rattled in her chest. There was no hope of extinguishing the torches before they saw her, and the darkness was her only ally in that cavern. The bearded man was a trained fighter, of that she was sure. She decided to take her chances with his companion. The other man was tall, lean, and young--no more than twenty years. His age encouraged the warrior within her, but Talina already felt the remorse of snuffing out a life so young.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men’s armor clattered with every step, echoing through the chamber. Talina remained perfectly still, but knew it was only a matter of seconds before one--or both--of the men saw her. She would have to strike, before the element of surprise was lost forever.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man stepped within some ten feet of Talina. The fog was heavy, so heavy, and the darkness was near-total. Should’ve brought my own torch, he thought, the night-skin can see far better than I in this damned cave. Another step, squinting through the fog. A ripple traced itself across the bath water. The man twisted his feet into a fighting stance, glaring so hard his head began to ache.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure that flew towards him looked no more like a Hemosi than a panther in the night. “She’s ri--” was all the boy could sputter before a silvered dagger found itself jammed under his jaw.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick red clouds swirled in the steaming water before him. My blood, my blood, that’s my blood… and the darkness became total.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Shit!” Halvin spat as he hustled towards the leaping shadow in the fog, the cry of his son. The boy - Tarna was his name - lay still, completely still, as the last spurts of blood splashed into the bath water. There was no time for mourning, yet, and the man knelt to pick up his son’s sword. His sword. A blade in each hand, Halvin felt an age-old bloodthirst taking him. It had been years since he had killed an islander, and he salivated at the thought. He was blind to the loss he and his wife had just suffered.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ornate, silvered dagger - bloodied to the handle - lay a few feet from the boy. Halvin kicked the weapon into the crimsoned bathwater. She was unarmed now, but the man heard nothing save the dripping of blood and water.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Come out, you moon-loving bitch! Come out and fight me!” Halvin screamed. He didn’t care if the entire settlement woke up and came running now, Maryk be damned.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As you wish,” came a voice from the darkness.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping forth from total obscurity, the Hemosi woman stood fully nude before Halvin, splatters of Tarna’s blood--Halvin’s blood--across her breasts and face. She stood peaceably, hands by her sides, palms forward. A sick smile cut her face like a fault-line. Rage took Halvin, seeing that smirk, and he charged her.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Time to die, night-skin!” he roared.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cacophonous sound, drowning out the echoes of Halvin’s roar. The Hemosi’s eyes shone a blinding white light, and her hands danced impossibly quick. So loud, was all Halvin could think as his mind felt numbed, erased by the screech. So cold, was his last thought, afterwards. A mess of blood--his blood--drenched the floor as he crashed face-first into the bedrock. Then, only silence and fog.</p>
