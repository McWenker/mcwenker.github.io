				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I told you she would be trouble, Maryk!” screamed the woman named Sharil.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene that the townsfolk had discovered was not a pretty one.The steambaths had been coated in the blood of one of the veteran guards--Halvin, grandson of the founder of Steamhearth--and his son, Tarna. The water was becoming a thick crimson as their wife and mother, respectively, screamed and fainted alongside some half-dozen residents. At swordpoint, Talina had willingly followed Maryk to what served as the settlement’s meeting hall. She wore only her undertunic, and was freezing.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was surprised to find that the caves were far larger than just the baths and a few residences. The majority of the settlement’s underground actually expanded below the steambaths, and beyond bottomless chasms that seemed to inhale the dense fog. The glow of lava was evident, far below, and Talina wondered how many of these fools would melt alive when Addom’s fury set the volcano ablaze. Some twenty or so residence chambers had been carved into the stone, and the few remaining stalagmites were shiny with sweaty residue. The caves were clearly still being expanded, indicated by the heavy mining equipment left at the end of tunnels every fifty feet or so in their descent.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very lowest level of the tunnel was a massive, semicircular chamber, lined by rough-hewn pews and centered by a podium of sorts. The screaming townsfolk--numbering near twice Talina’s initial estimate of fifty--clambered in and around the pews, while she stood between Maryk and another guard at the podium.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cacophony was angry, but otherwise indiscernible, as folk screamed over and at one another. They were Quosh, to the very last child, but it seemed even some within the Dominion were favorable towards those such as Talina, those officially deemed “lesser folk”. Yet most of them cried for her immediate execution. Poryl was nowhere to be found, and Talina wondered how many other residents had simply kept their heads down.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Enough!” bellowed Maryk, for what seemed the hundredth time. “Enough of this madness! Silence, I say!”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a emphatic banging of his gauntlet upon the podium, the crowd began to settle as Maryk repeated his command. Talina saw a collective fury unlike any she had encountered before.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Talina of Miramar, you have broken the laws of the Quosh’ari Dominion, and of Steamhearth,” began the captain, when the din had quieted. “You have betrayed the trust of not only myself, but the entire settlement. I tend to agree with the demands for your execution, but in this Dominion we offer all a fair trial, even those not of our blood. Consider that a blessing. So, what say you in your defense?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ser Maryk, noble folk of Steamhearth,” she began. Every word would need to be perfectly chosen, and even then her chances felt slim. “I stand before you not a murderer, but merely a woman who chose to defend herself in the face of wanton violence.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd roared once more, punctuating her statement before it had even finished. She ducked as a stone was tossed towards the podium, dodging it without difficulty. Maryk roared like an angered bear, and the residents quieted without further provocation.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will not have this madness within our halls!” he followed up. “We will have ourselves a civil trial, like dignified folk. Is that understood?!”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collective murmur seemed to understand just fine.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You claim self-defense, Hemosi,” Maryk continued. “What say you of the illegal stowing of weaponry through our gates? Of the black magic used to kill the most valuable defender of our settlement? Of the boy you killed?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collective murmur seemed to echo every question.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I say again,” Talina said through an impatient grimace, “that boy I killed, and his father--your best fighter, you say--came to the steambaths fully armed, as you found them, seeking to end my life. I know the laws of your Dominion as well as my homeland’s, and there is no punishment for the practice of defensive magicks. Your very emperor--blessing of Holy Sollus upon him--practices defensive magic in place of martial talent. Surely he would not hold such an act against me as a crime.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collective murmur rose again. I should not have invoked their emperor, it seems.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you know these things so well, islander,” said the other guard - Talina did not know his name, “you would know that Emperor Vanyl--blessing of Holy Sollus and Great Addom upon him--cannot use any of his so-called ‘defensive magic’ out of the light of day. Not only was the moon high in the sky as you bathed in our hospitality, but you were buried some fifty leagues within the earth! Only black magic can kill at night, or underground. You are a witch, Hemosi, admit it and die with a dash of dignity.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collective murmur surged to a crest. The unnamed guard was knowledgeable in the powers of the gods, Talina noted, but she also saw the corner they were backing her into.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“These things are all true, noble samoi,” she replied, and the crowd quieted once more. “I am a witch, of the Hemosi islands. Surely you must have guessed this when I revealed my identity to your captain at the gates. There is not a woman in Miramar who does not know the powers of Ergor and Squqaros. Yet these things are beside the point! Your Halvin, and even his son, came to me bearing steel and wishing me dead. Who among you would die willingly to such an unwarranted attempt? Must I simply bend my neck to their blades because they dislike the color of my flesh?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collective roar was their answer. Bigots, the lot of them, Talina thought as her jaw clenched in rage. The unnamed guard seized her by the shoulders, and shoved her to the ground.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Talina of Miramar,” began Maryk, a foul air of superiority to his words, “for crimes committed against the people of Steamhearth, the Quosh’ari Dominion, and Emperor Vanyl, you have been sentenced to death by the sword. Your remains will be buried in the saint-yard alongside innocent Quosh’ari, whose spirits may guide you to a peaceful afterlife. Have you any final words?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina’s mouth opened, but another voice echoed through the hall.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Just what in the blazes are you fools doing?!” it was Poryl. The old man was hobbling down the steps into the chamber, leaning on metal staff that clacked with every movement.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This woman has committed murder, Poryl,” replied the captain. “Of a guardsman and a boy, nonetheless. You know the law.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Indeed, I know the law,” said the old man. “I also know how to think with my own damned head! Haven’t you thought for even a second how useful this one could be to our little village?</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murmur quivered through the crowd--it seemed many in Steamhearth looked up to the eccentric man. Clack, clack, clack went his staff as he passed through the parting in the crowd that formed naturally</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What are you on about, old man?” said the unnamed guard</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am ‘on about’ dealing with our bandit problem, young Wilbet. And mind your manners, boy, it’s me your father owed his life to during the last famine, don’t forget that.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clack, clack echoed the staff as Poryl climbed the podium, uninvited</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was utterly silent now, save the faint whispers of wind trickling in from the distant outdoors. Poryl cleared his throat, and even the quiet gesture seemed to reverberate like thunder in the cavernous space.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My friends, family, fellow townsfolk,” he began. “It would seem we have a foreign witch in our midst--one capable of killing two fully armed and armored men with nothing more than a shaving dagger and a few words. This is not the type of asset you just throw away! Have you all forgotten that we have not received a food shipment in nearly a month?! Have you not realized we have bandits prowling the passes to our humble settlement, stealing that which we have paid for and rightfully own?”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clear - from the collective shame evident in the crowd - that in their new anger, they had indeed forgotten.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What I am suggesting is thus: do not kill this Hemosi witch. Instead pit one foe against another, like the intelligent Quosh’ari you are. If this woman could kill two men--while nude, might I add--imagine what she could do to those bandits fully armed and ready for battle! And if she fails, your execution has been dealt - with I wager more than a few of the bandits eliminated in the process. Two birds killed with one stone, as they once said.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was instantaneous. The crowd again acted as a single entity, voicing an unanimous support for Poryl’s plan.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheepishly, Maryk and Wilbet lifted Talina to her feet again.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sorry,” said the captain under the echoes of the residents.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina merely met his gaze.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow had died out by dawn, leaving a glimmering coating over everything, nearly a foot deep. The sun shined out over it all, creating a blinding wall anywhere that Talina risked looking. She preferred to travel by night - as was the Hemosi way - but Maryk said it may take her all day to reach the bandits’ assumed territory. She hoped he was wrong.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina had no chance of resisting Poryl’s plan. Of course, she could turn west again, never return to the settlement, and leave the bigots to their own troubles. For that alone, she could thank the old man ten thousand times. But Steamhearth sat atop one of the few underground passes through the Skyshatter Mountains, and bypassing the mountains themselves would add months to her journey--months through the heart of Syrnian occupation. That would mean dodging slavers and the military alike, and she had done enough of that just to reach Steamhearth. Besides, Talina had little worries about taking on a few Quosh’ari mountain bandits.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The settlement had offered her food and supply, which Talina had sparingly accepted. It was strange, the kindliness being shown by people who had wished her death only the night before. Steamhearth was her first encounter with a Quosh settlement, and with their culture. The rumors she had heard in the westerlands appeared true: they were a pragmatic and opportunistic folk, that never forgot a favor--nor misdeed.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning of her preparation had introduced her to Halvin’s wife. The woman had come with a group of others, offering Talina winter clothing that she had largely denied - save a woolen scarf that had been dyed a deep grey. It had been Tarna’s scarf.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Wear it, and do not forget the fire you snuffed out before its brightest glimmer,” the woman had said. Talina was somber, never breaking the woman’s extinguished gaze.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had joined Maryk and the upstart guardsman Wilbet in the preparation of the slain pair’s graves, doing the brunt of the digging herself. Despite the sunny chill, Talina broke a healthy sweat with the labor. It was the least she could do. Addom flowers were left atop the stones, their scarlet petals like drops of blood in the shining snow. Some words were said, and Talina found herself remorseful for the men that had wished her dead. But she would not be stopped by petty bigotry, not now.</p>
				</br>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was prepared to leave, Talina went back into Poryl’s. The old man had been awake before dawn, and Talina wondered if he had slept at all. When she first awoke that morning he served her hot breakfast, which awaited her at the foot of the stairs. Before her departure, the man was once more tinkering with his killing device.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s time I head out,” said Talina. “Thank you again for your help.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat up, turning from his work. The thick spectacles again gave his eyes an inhuman size, but his faint smile was warmer than the fire that seemed to perpetually blaze in his hearth.</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It was the least I could do, Talina of Miramar,” he said. And then, after some pause: “I understand the trials that your people have faced; are facing. I hoped that here, among my own kin, you would be spared such ignorance. It shames me that it was not so. I pray that you find greater acceptance in your journeys eastward.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ve got to go west first, old man,” she smirked, “thanks to you.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ha! Yes, yes you do. But I fear not for your luck in that matter. A couple of ruffian boys won’t be any match for one of your talent.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina’s smirked wiped away. Just how much did this old eccentric know?</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh yes... I’ve seen the Whitewash before, young witch,” he said, reading her mind. “Though never so… thoroughly. I would be honored to meet your tutor, someday.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina’s surprise became sorrow. “Then you will have to wait til your walk up the Golden Stair, friend. My matron is no more.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poryl’s brow creased, in a look of sadness and shame. “I feared as much. Now, no sense in missing those who will guide us on that long climb--go now, and earn the justice you already deserve. And send those hooligans to your matron if they try and stop you.”</p>
				<p class="longform-writing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talina thought she loved the old Quosh’ari.</p>
