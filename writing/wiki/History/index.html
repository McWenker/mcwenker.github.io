			<h2>The Beginning (#be)</h2>

			<h4>The Age of Beasts (B)</h4>

			<p>For centuries the world grew under Ergor’s will and Addom’s endless power. Beasts--lead by the Leanor'e--had risen to masters of the land granted to them by their Great Father, Ergor. Leanor'e mages would create the first Aetrocs, serving as slaves to the growing civilizations of Leanor.<br>In the early centuries B Leanor'e established the first spoken language, written texts, schools, laws, and weapons of war. Abalnairu would develop their own spoken language in this age as well, and construct the world's first great cities in their desert homeland. Their artists' works would be the envy of the earth for ages.<br>The Aetrocs, lead by a number of revolutionaries in the 5th and 6th centuries B, would largely earn their freedom through bloodshed before establishing their own cultures across the mortal plane. The first sailing practices would be established in this time. Many Aetrocs would migrate to Savinar, Hemos, and as far as Syrn.<br>From the 7th to 15th centuries B, Avon'e culture would establish itself across southern Orya, but individual tribes remain fairly insular. Ratter, Bjurnix, and other Beast races would establish similar small cultures across Orya.<br>By the end of the age, Aetroc warlords and the first Leanor’e emperors had solidified their territorial claims and battled over land, liberty, and love. The world had fallen into a natural balance, the seemingly-eternal Cycle of life and death. But it could go on no longer. Sollus would make sure of that.</p>

			<h4>The First Titan War (T)</h4>

			<p>The Age of Beasts ended the day that Sollus arrived from the void, commanding his newly-forged weapon: Mankind.<br>The races of man were built to conquer. Created by the vengeful Titan to bring an end to the world of Ergor, they were merciless, automatonic creatures with a passion for bloodshed and genocide. Quickly making their mark on the world they had invaded, mankind lead to the first unified force of Beasts since the Beginning. The First Titan War had begun.<br>Lead by the Leanor'e shaman Dreadmane, Chosen of Ergor, the Beast army numbered nearly 15 million strong. First meeting the forces of man upon the plains of Shar in T2, the Beast army began suffering a catastrophic defeat due to Sollus' direct interference in the battle. Ergor, channeling himself through the powers of a young Ceutei witch, brought forth three children to defend the young mortal plane. Illia, Mara, and Aiya were born rending earth, sea, and sky in a mighty attack. Shar was shattered, sinking into the sea, and millions of men and beasts perished in the battle and following disaster.<br>Ergor's time to strike back came in T3 as the deceased Dreadmane's forces continued an eastward migration into Orya. The Titan attacked Sollus directly, binding his brother with a powerful curse that severed him from the mortal plane and mankind from their creator. Soon humanity fractured among its contours like shattered glass, and within a year the mighty extermination force had turned inward on itself in a series of bloody conflicts.<br>The warring Titans, both unable to muster the power to act within the mortal plane, withdrew in an uneasy truce, their powers absent from the realm for ages to come. The forces of Beast and Man were severely bloodied, and life was all but exterminated by a powerful ice age that swept over the world in T12.</p>

		<div id="The_First_Age_of_Man">
			<h2>The First Age of Man (M)</h2>

			<p>The races of man rose to prominence during and after the ice age. The Rumani Thunderkin that would found the nation of Syrn traveled across the frozen seas, arriving at their blighted-yet-promised land in the 3rd century M before many tunneled deep into the earth. Those that were left behind on the frozen surface became known as the Walmer.<br>The Novani Thunderkin, reacquiring the use of magic like their elemental cousins, conquered much of the Nov'ru islands in the 5th century M and enslaved the Novani Ceutei nations. Fighting a brutal, stagnant war against their cousins that remained in Ru, the Novani instead turned eastward towards the lands of Abaln and Orya. In the 7th and 8th centuries M, Many Durmari traveled to the more  temperate coasts of Erg and Leanord, allying with the Beast natives as they hunted whale and squid. It is the first recorded cooperation between human and Beast.<br>The Novani Empire established dominion over Novanos, northern Abaln, and western Orya from M767, their kingdom eventually crumbling inward on itself when the ruling dynasty succumbed to the Trembling in M1876. In their wake they would leave behind independent cultures in Abaln and Orya, known as Qovan and Limanu respectively.<br>Abalni settlers in Orya - isolated from their cultural homeland among Beasts and facing persecution at the hands of the Limanu - began establishing a new culture based on education, rule of law, and feudalism. Uniting under a powerful warmagi to drive back the hordes of Limanu warriors, the Quosh'ari Dominion was born in M1913 as the first true springs returned.<br>As the seas warmed in the 20th century M, the Durmari began seeking food on land in greater numbers--the first Northern, fully-landwalking Durmari are born. The end of the age the Rumani living on Orya grew into the Hemosi culture, the first humans to widely worship Ergor.<br>The Leanor'e reestablished control over northern Orya as the Novani conquerers returned home or were assimilated into Qovan culture. Throughout the 21st century M, Leanord engaged in a series of noncommital wars and uneasy truces with the massive Aetroc hordes that had grown in the years following the thawing age. Leanor'e and Quosh'ari began trade and cooperation in the 21st century M, marking the first international commerce in history; both cultures boomed as a result of the exchange of ideas and languages.<br>The Quosh'ari began to expand across southern Orya and Abaln in the 23rd and 24th centuries M, finding themselves entrenched in bloody conflicts against Oryan Aetrocs, a fledgling Hemosi Nation, and a revived Novani Empire. The simultaneous warfare battered the Dominion into withdrawing from Erg and the rest of northern Orya. The Dominion would fracture when the ice age briefly resurged in the 25th century M; continued conflict with the Novani would prove too much for the Quosh'ari as famines killed millions. The Dominion left a slew of child factions and city-states in its place that would come to distinguish themselves as Quoryan or merely Quosh. The High Quosh'ari would return to a mere fraction of their former glory by the end of the age, officially establishing the Quosh'ari Empire in M2765.<br>The Novani - emboldened by their victory over the Quosh'ari - launch an invasion into Ru in M2496. After centuries of war the defending Rumani make a blood sacrifice in the name of the Mad God, giving birth to Addom's son, Rucaln. M2873 is known as the Year of Fire. Countless humans and beasts die in the eruptions and chaos that follows.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="The_God_Wars">
			<h2>The God Wars (G)</h2>

			<p>The birth of Rucaln decimated the earth throughout M2873, lifting mountains from the sea and sinking portions of of Orya and Syrn into the depths. The brief following ice age (G0-G12) was countered by a long hot age (G13-G729). An abundant shallow sea quickly rose into the desert of southern Orya in the 2nd century G, and the Simaal'i were born of those Northern Durmari forced ashore in massive migrations. The destructive heat and drying of the earth buried Abalnairu cites, driving them into a culture of perpetual nomadicism in the 3rd century G.<br>As Rucaln's reign of terror drew into its 4th century, humankind from Orya to Nov'ru become slaves to a massive plague of the Trembling. Lead by Rumani magelords, humanity waged a war of destruction across Nov'ru, Abaln and Orya from 477G. Blessed by Ergor's renewed strength, a combined force of Beasts met mankind upon the fields of southern Orya in 479G. Empowered by a mighty spell, Ergor's three daughters buried the human army in a silt-laden wave. The Lifewater Valley--a powerful beacon of Ergor's magic--was created from the corpses of countless dead. Humanity was broken of its curse, and what remained of its civilizations struggled to reform from the 5th century G to the end of the age.<br>Seeking vengeance against his cousins, Rucaln fled to the southern land of Syrn. Stealing Ergorian magic, Rucaln spoke ambition into the mind of a young Syrnian Emperor, Abaddon Steelsoul. Leading his people from their subterranean home for the first time in G613, Steelsoul united the various factions of Imperial Syrnians and allied with the tribes of Walmer. By G622, Steelsoul had brought about the complete eradication of Beasts on the Syrnian continent. With each victory Rucaln granted the Empire greater power, and in G624 they began an invasion of the Hemosi archipelago.<br>Seeking a means to drive back the invaders, the Hemosi king began a spell to summon the power of the Three Goddesses once more. However, the Royal Court fell victim to a fit of the Trembling in G627, and the spell was corrupted by Addom's insanity. The Hemosi were cursed, but the spell did drive back Syrn by the end of G627. Steelsoul was bound to his holy icon, gaining immortality at the cost of his humanity. The Empire would topple in a dark age of violence as the Steelsoul Hammer was lost in retreat across the islands in the end of the 7th century G.<br>The 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries G were marked by a return to a colder age, as the Squqarox Virus decimated mortal populations in Southern Orya, Hemos, and Syrn. Cultures worldwide were stagnated by constant tribal conflicts over precious farm and hunting land.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="The_Second_Age">
			<h2>The Second Age (S)</h2>

			<p>The worst of the ice age subsided in S0, and the Hemosi reestablished themselves as a collage of small states in southern Orya. They allied themselves with tribes of Avon'e--whom they taught written and spoken language in the 1st century S. The resurgance of Quosh culture began as the Quosh Republic and Qovan Kingdom rose in northern Abaln in the 1st and 2nd centuries S. The two nations joined themselves with the Quosh'ari Empire in the east, and the Dominion was reborn in their alliance. As the gateway between Nov'ru, Quosh Abaln, and Sh'ar, the Qovan city of Boltstrike became the capitol of the northern world.<br>Leanord rose to supremacy on the Oryan continent early in the age, expanded south of the Skyshatters in the 2nd century S, and enjoyed a long period of philosophical and artistic expression. The countless tribes of Limanu and Simaal'i eventaully united into the Simaal'i'Lima Confederacy and drove Leanord back into the north in S410s . The Confederacy then peacefully fractured into the Simaal'i Sultanate and a collection of Limanu city-states. <br>After leading a successful expedition to find the Steelsoul Hammer in 467S, Baktrus Steelsoul--long descendent of Abaddon--united the warring Syrnian nations into the Principality of Syrn in S472. In S474, Baktrus discovered the Godspark and established the Steamcult, and Syrnian culture boomed in an industrial revolution and Syrn became the southern capitol of humanity. In S476, Baktrus invented the firespear--the first gunpowder weapon. In late S476, the Principality invaded Hemos once more - utilizing their newfound weaponry to devastating effect.<br>By S482, the Principality had conquered all of Hemos as well as southern Orya and Savinar, and established a robust slave-driven industry. Under the leadership of Prince Tyrhan Blackblade, Savinar broke from Syrn and the Steamcult in S483, resulting in a bloody civil war. From S483-487, the Principality finds its conquests slowed by growing Aetroc forces along the Skyshatters.<br>In S487 a Hemosi witch named Talina of Miramar allies Hemosi, Aetroc, Bjurnix, and Savini forces in a coalition against the Principality. After gaining a decisive upper hand into early S488, Talina's death demoralizes the coalition and they are eventually routed. With the death of Blackblade, Savinar established the Merchant Council in S488 and became the first cosmopolitan city in history.<br>By S499 Syrn had expanded north into Orya, defeating and enslaving Aetrocs, a revived Simaal'i'Lima Confederacy, and the Quosh'ari Dominion. Conquest of northern Abaln and Nov'Ru proved difficult for the Principality, as a guerrilla coalition of Ceutei, Novani, and Ru had managed to match Syrn's weaponry in the field. Seeking a solution to the insurgency, Baktrus sought to use ancient Rumani magic to overcome the Rumani mages facing him. Casting a mad spell upon the Steelsoul Hammer, Baktrus was taken by the Trembling, and waged a dark crusade against life itself. Countless lives were taken by the Squqarox Virus as the Principality crumbled in its madness by S502.</p>
