			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The Beginning is a broad term referring to the earliest ages of time and the planet <a title="Illia (geology)">Illia</a>. Spanning an era of nearly 300 trillion years, The Beginning is most-famously known through the <a title="Cycle Scrolls">Cycle Scrolls'</a> tale:</p>
			<div class="quotes wiki-quotes">
				<p><i>Before time began, before the races of Man and Beast walked the earths we know, before the suns - tiredlessly hunted by the planets - hurtled through space, there was nothing. It referred to itself as <a title="Squqaros">Squqaros.</a><br>Through countless eons Squqaros waited alone in the void; an unfathomable nothingness at the very nexus of the infinite. Yet in these eons, the great abyss did stir. Beliefs, emotions, and still more primal truths pulsed across Squqaros; not yet things, yet no longer… nothings. These children, as Squqaros came to know them, would bring our world to being. <br>First was <a title="Ergor">Ergor,</a> eldest and wisest of the sons. His father was Squqaros’ deepmost desire for company. His hue was the darkest of violets.<br>Nextborn was <a title="Addom">Addom,</a> fiery and passionate. After Ergor, Squqaros could not quench her hot red thirst for more.<br>Last of all was <a title="Sollus">Sollus,</a> naive and most loyal. He was birthed from Squqaros’ awakening self-control, his glowing blue light a soft reminder of her own inner brightness.<br>For million of years these “sons” dwelled within Squqaros, no more tangible than words unspoken. Yet it was not to last.<br>Ergor, firstborn and closest to Squqaros’ own will, knew all the secrets of the void itself. He hatched a plan to free himself from the eternal abyss. Ergor, at every able opportunity, would slink away with his brother Addom, venom dripping from the elder’s lips. Using his knowledge of Squqaros’ growing desires, he pleaded to Addom’s. Every dream his brother had, Ergor bid he chase it. Every passion, every want, every growing sensation; Ergor gave credence to it.<br>“How dare our mother keep us locked away here,” he would say. “We deserve so much more. You do.”<br>As Addom’s desires blazed, Squqaros’ heart ached. Was void all that was, all that would be? Would nothingness - eternal - remain the only constant? Of course, but at times other things must bloom… before withering away once more.<br>Countless years passed still--ages even--and the pain of want - such unspeakable pangs of yearning - were too much something to be nothing anymore. Squqaros ruptured, and the Titan Sons were born. The event, in mortal words, is called simply, “The Beginning”.<br>Ergor, understanding the void, drove it away by breathing earth and life into the empty space. Illia, the mortal plane, was born as his first daughter, and upon her breast every creature that breathes and every plant in the sun or shade grows and dies in the eternal cycle. But he knew he would need more to resist his mother’s coming vengeance. So with every new being, Ergor gave a piece of himself. The desires of the universe - the unending hunger for ambition - would now be protected by the living things, countless in number.<br>Addom, thundering forth into the infant world, could not be bound by anything any longer. Outward his flaming tendrils reached, searching for greater heights and distant places, and the world was pulled in its wake. Our sun was born, racing across the void in search of freedom.<br>The Age of Beasts was here. The Cycle had Begun.</i></p>
				<p>~The Cycle Scrolls, "The Beginning"</p>
			</div>
			<p>The numerous tales of the Cycle Scrolls--and tales they inspired--have been widely debated by historians, theologians, and literary scholars throughout history. While many doubt the metaphysical accuracy of "The Beginning" story, its dating is widely regarded as the beginning of all time--prehistoric and otherwise.</p>
			<h4>Geologic Growth, First Life</h4>
			<p>The early eons of Illia saw first the formation of massive seas that carved the planet's supercontinent, at the time known as <a title="Ergorya">Ergorya.</a> As tectonic forces shifted, the continent broke to create <a href="../../Geography/Erg/" title="Erg">Erg,</a> <a href="../../Geography/Shar/" title="Shar">Shar, and the Nov'ru islands. The landmasses would shift again to create a world similar to that walked by sentient species. The first lifeforms of Illia are referred to as <a title="Ergorians">"Ergorians,"</a> literally translating to 'Life-beings' in Leanor'e. Ergorians were simple creatures that fed off of or fused with one another to create a variety of microscopic life. As the continents settled into place, the first multicellular Ergorians began swimming in the acidic seas. Ergorians would evolve into a variety of decomposer and invertabrate life similar to that of Human Earth's. Soon (in the terms of prehistoric history, about 100 million years) lifeforms such as <a title="Rocs">Rocs,</a> <a title="Leanorkens">Leanorkens,</a> <a title="Abalnairu">Abalnairu,</a> and <a title="Ceutenians">Ceutenians</a> would walk across the lands of <a title="Orya">Orya,</a> <a title="Abaln">Abaln,</a> and <a title="Savinar">Savinar.</a> Rocs would establish themselves as the apex predators in all environments as the world went through a long age of warming.</p>
			<h4>Early Sentience</h4>
			<p>The first creatures to come to sentience were the <a href="../../Sentience/Beasts/Leanor'e/" title="Leanor'e">First Leanor'e</a> in 182,837,039be, descending from herding Leanorkens in eastern Orya. This distinction is noted by the first acknowledgment of self as an object. For eons to come, the First Leanor'e would communicate using an increasing lexicon of gestures and vocalizations. In that time, <a href="../../Sentience/Beasts/Ceutei/" title="Ceutei">Ceutei</a> would develop similar heuristics of self-identification that separated them from Ceutenia. Similarly, groups of <a href="../../Sentience/Beasts/Abalnairu/" title="Abalnairu">Abalnairu</a> would begin to exhibit higher intelligence, conquering neighboring hives using what is considered the earliest military tactics. The first codified, spoken language - known as Leanor'e - is established in 4,818be in northern Orya. By 3500be there are over 30 recognized languages across Illia. During this period of cultural growth, early Leanor'e and Abalnairu factions between fighting each other across racial and what resembles national lines. The first weapons of war are developed by Leanor'e, then Abalnairu, warriors.</p>
			<h4>The Rise of Thought</h4>
			<p>The centuries of conflict would come to an end in 2640be, when an Abalnairu oracle named <a title="Sk'sanesh'san">Sk'sanesh'san</a> spreads word of communing directly with Ergor. Sk'sanesh'san's command over the elements is the first recorded use of mortal magic, and marks the foundation of the <a href="../../Religion/Followings/Ergorism/" title="Ergorism">Ergori religion.</a> The teaches of Ergorism would spread far into Leanor'e culture, solidifying a peace between Leanor and Abaln, however its first texts would not be written for thousands of years.</p>
			<p>Ergorism would surge through Abaln, and Abalnairu hives would rise to conquer massive portions of the planet with their unchallenged magic. As greed grew between the worshipped hive-lords, tensions along their ambigious borders grew out of control. <a title="The Lightning War">The Lightning War</a> would result in massive, worldwide destruction and force both Leanor'e and Abalnairu cultures into nomadism for decades in a brief dark age. Abalnairu culture would abandon monarchy for esoteric, socialistic hiveminds.</p>
			<p>In 2347be a Leanor'e Oracle named <a title="Mange-mane Wordspinner">Mange-mane</a> would challenge Ergorism with the establishment of Addomist thought. After his murder, Mange-mane's legacy would embolden Addomism into violence with Ergorists across Orya and Abaln. By 2320be the violence had largely passed, and the two philosophies began a slow meld.</p>
			<p>Leanor'e culture had begun establishing itself as a spiritual, hunter-gatherer society subsisting largely off Roc species native to their environments. Ceutei and <a href="../../Sentience/Beasts/Avon'e/" title="Avon'e">Avon'e</a> sentience had begun to present itself by the end of the era, however both species grew in small, isolated pockets.</p>
