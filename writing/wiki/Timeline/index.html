		<h3>The Beginning, 300,000,000,000,000 - 0be</h3>

<p>
300,000,000,000,000be - The Twin Titans escape from Squqaros, begin creating Illia. The Titan Sons are born.<br>
299,999,999,999,999be - Illia is born, and the races of Beast begin to grow<br>
208,187,918,839,827be - The first of the animal kingdom hereby referred to as Roc is expressed. Rocs are - in appearance - largely the same as lizards in our dimension. However, they are warm blooded herd creatures that primarily feed upon active lava flows or bacterial mats. As the Illian ecosystem begins to evolve, their diets adapt to being commonly herbivorous.<br>
5,182,837,039be - The first of the species hereby referred to as Leanor’e is expressed. Leanor’e show similar features to homo sapien, however more feline in facial appearance and spinal structure (tails, yo). The first sentient creatures of Illia, Leanor’e first come to prominence in eastern Orya, near the subcontinent of Savinar. Throughout 5,182 and 2,000be they expand across the entirety of the continent Orya. As with all species that would follow them, their methods of communication in this era consisted primarily of body language and uncodified noises.<br>
1,904,933,039be - The first of the genus hereby referred to as Ceutei is expressed. Ceutei are intelligent, hierarchical creatures that are - without exception - fight or flight. While actually a number of individual species, Ceutei are considered - by the other sentient races of Illia - to be two distinct geological groups. The natural range of the Novani Ceutei is the entirety of the Novanos’ru island chain; the natural range of the Oryan Ceutei is southern Orya. The creatures express latent magical powers in about one tenth of their population, leading to myth and superstitions aplenty.<br>
1,209,827,039be - The first of the species hereby referred to as Abalnairu is expressed. Abalnairu are insectoid in appearance although vaguely centaur in shape, bearing 2 to 6 pairs of legs in addition to a pair of manual limbs. After interactions with the Leanor’e, the Abalnairu quickly come to a sentience their own. Far less autonomous than their feline neighbors, the quickly-growing hives seek far lands, and by 4,000 their populations extend from northern Orya to as far as Syrn.<br>
4,818be - Leanor’e living in northern Orya codify the first recognized spoken language.<br>
4,800-3,000be - Primitive territorial disputes break out between Abalnairu and Leanor’e factions. While hardly a war by any contemporary standards, the violence leads to the first known development of tools of war.<br>
c.3,500be - There are over thirty recognized languages across Illia<br>
2,640be - An Abalnairu Oracle, Sk’sanesh’san, communes with Ergor. The Titan bestows upon the oracle the power of Ergori magic. Ergorism is the first recorded religion - spreading well into Leanor’e culture, however its first texts would not be written for thousands of years.<br>
2,400-2,300be - A fierce war among Abalnairu factions leads to the general destruction of known civilizations. The hives of Abalnairu are deemed unfit by the magic-wielding creatures, and their populations shrivel into small nomadic pockets. The first known domestication of Rocs takes place in this era, as the Abalnairu of their namesake continent Abaln begin taming the creatures for desert travel. What few Leanor’e remain return to nomadic lifestyles.<br>
2,347-2,320be - A Leanor’e Oracle, Mange-mane Wordspinner, claims to have communed with Addom. The first known Leanor’e to possess magical talent, Mange-mane attracts a large following before his sudden murder. The cult left in his wake establishes Addomism, and violence with Ergorists briefly flares. The two philosophies soon begin a slow meld.<br>
2,274be - The first of the species hereby referred to as Avon’e is expressed. Avon’e are birdlike in appearance, however built like lithe homo sapien children. Their short lifespans - and memories - give many the image of Avon’e as mindlessly savage creatures. However, their esoteric culture quickly develops into that of rich history. The first recorded (by oral tradition) international leader in Illia, Lor Kag Pek Ban, was an Avon’e chieftain of thousands that lead them to settle across southern Orya.

B448 - Enslavement of Aetroc lizardmen begins<br>
B463 - First Aetroc Revolt:<br>
A series of battles unfold as an Aetroc provocateur, Prak Stullsnout, leads an organized resistance against the Stonetooth Empire. The Leanor’e take considerable casualties - many civilian - in the conflict, but are victorious. Stullsnout is exiled to a deserted island to die. New rules about the treatment of Aetroc slaves are drafted, and the fledgling Empire’s first codified book of rights is signed into law.<br>
B512 - Prak Stullsnout escapes exile, leads series of raids on Stonetooth frontier. Prak and freebeast from these raids form the first Aetroc tribe<br>
B536 - Prak Stullsnout dies of old age. His last words, to friends and elders: “The sky parted when we left the oppressors. I could feel the sun, the wind on my flesh. Bring this freedom to all kin.”<br>
B547-552 - First Beast War<br>
The growing Aetroc freebeast tribes lead numerous raids on Stonetooth bordertowns. Emperor Black-mane, using xenophobic rhetoric, builds support for a war of extermination. Black-mane’s army delays in order to grow before crushing the Aetroc horde at the Battle of Blue Rock, driving the encroaching lizard army into the wilds. Black-mane then leads an exhaustive effort against the guerrilla forces in the mountains before he is killed in an ambush. His daughter Steel-claw ends the persecution and brings the army home. Further slave laws are established, and Steel-claw signs the infamous Black-mane Order, allowing any and all free Aetrocs to be taken as slaves.<br>
B552-587 - Anti-slavery sentiment begins stirring in Leanor’e cities. Prominent merchant Green-eye Bladetongue begins public vendetta against the Stonetooth Dynasty, expressing concern over the Black-mane Order<br>
B587-589 - Second Beast War<br>
A surprise Aetroc attack in the capital of Leanor leaves dozens of civilians dead and no Aetroc survivors. The Grimwater Tribe claims responsibility for the attack after a series of follow-up raids along the Stonetooth border. Slaveowning Leanor’e are publicly tortured and killed by citizens within the Empire. Empress Steel-claw calls for order within the Empire, threatening death to any Beast--lizard or lion--that questions the supremacy of Stonetooth. After a series of pyrrhic victories along the frontier, Steel-claw defeats the Grimwater Tribe and returns home. She is ambushed by a rebel army, flying the banner of Bladetongue, and her army is killed to the Beast. Green-eye Bladetongue proclaims the end of the Stonetooth Dynasty, and the beginning of the Leanor’e Republic.<br>
B589 - The survivors of the Grimwater, lead by Drakesh Grimwater - a 1 year whelp - travel northwest and settle the island of Erg. Nearly seven hundred depart on the pilgrimage, under one hundred survive.<br>
B589-673 - Leanor’e Civil War / The War of Addom’s Tears
