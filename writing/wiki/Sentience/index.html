		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>
		All sentience on Illia came to be at the whim of the Titans. Ergor is the Great Father of all Beast life, the countless species that evolved in the early ages. First to exist were tiny lifeforms known as later Ergorians, from them eventually the first creature known as Roc would leave the primordial sea and walk land. Many eons later, the Leanor'e would be the first intelligent life on the plane. In the First Titan War, Sollus brought the races of humanity to the Illia to wage war on Beastkind, but the belligerent race fractured into countless cultures. The youngest - and perhaps most unlikely - sentient lifeforms on Illia are strains of microscopic lifeforms known to many as the Titan Plagues.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="Beasts">
		<h2>Beasts</h2>

		<p>
		Born of Ergor's magic to resist the Void, Beasts were the first life in the mortal realm. Evolving from single-celled Ergorians, Beasts have long shared a deep connection to earth. After long periods of free growth in the Age of Beasts, they were crushed in the First Titan War. For ages the races of Beast waged defensive wars against human expansion, experiencing periods of swell and decay, until uniting to defeat the Principality of Syrn in the Dark Days. Intensely spiritual creatures, most Beasts loathe the wanton destruction of Humanity's "progress." The beasts would not join humanity on the Voidwander, later battling them in the Final Titan War.
		</p>

		<div class="info-sub1" id="Leanor'e">
			<h3><a title="Leanor'e" href="Beasts/Leanor'e/">Leanor'e</a></h3>

			<p>
			The first sentient creatures of the mortal plane, the catlike Leanor'e are credited with the discovery of agriculture, the first spoken and written languages, and the first weapons of war. Establishing the first empire in history, Leanor'e culture influenced all cultures to follow it--through art, trade, and warfare.
			</p>

			<div class="info-sub2">
				<h4><a title="Ravin" href="Beasts/Leanor'e/index.html#Ravin">Ravin</a></h4>

				<p>
				The brutish warrior caste of Leanord, the Ravin are proud martial combatants with a rich lineage of military success against humanity. Intensely loyal, the Ravin have long dedicated themselves to protecting their weaker cousins. Despite a rich history of regimental warfare, many Ravin take it upon themselves to prove their individual worth. Adventurers of all types are common amongst the adaptable Ravin.
				</p>

				<h4><a title="Qa'el" href="Beasts/Leanor'e/index.html#Qa'el">Qa'el</a></h4>

				<p>
				Leonord's governing class, the Qa'el are ingenious thinkers and passionate artists. With clever minds for politics and strategy, they also possess a rich tradition of culture and academics. Despite recent wars with the humans of Savinar and the Ergori clans, the Qa’el remain the face of international diplomacy, and Qa’el are found in royal halls from Syrn to Novanos.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="info-sub1" id="Ceutei">
			<h3><a title="Ceutei" href="Beasts/Ceutei">Ceutei</a></h3>

			<p>
			The second sentient creatures of Illia, the Ceutei are intelligent, hierarchical creatures that - without exception - highly instinctual. While actually a number of individual species, Ceutei are considered - by the other sentient races of Illia - to be two distinct geological groups. The natural range of the Novani Ceutei is the entirety of the Novanos’ru island chain; the natural range of the Oryan Ceutei is southern Orya. The creatures express latent magical powers in about one tenth of their population, leading to myth and superstitions aplenty.
			</p>

			<div class="info-sub2">
				<h4><a title="Novani" href="Beasts/Ceutei/index.html#Novani">Novani</a></h4>

				<p>
				Once a proud race of academics and engineers, the Novani Ceutei were long subjugated by the Novani Empire after the First Titan War. Their culture was rekindled by Illia's industrial revolution, ushering them into a technological leadership alongside the Principality. Their numerous wars with the races of man have enkindled a sense of mistrust in humanity. Eccentric, energetic, and at times... quite annoying; they cherish the companionship of Illia’s other diminutive races.
				</p>

				<h4><a title="Oryan" href="Beasts/Ceutei/index.html#Oryan">Oryan</a></h4>
	
				<p>
				Once a sheltered folk hidden away by the magic of the goddess Illia, Oryan Ceutei's safety was shattered when the Hemosi empire fell. However, they have fared quite well in the chaos that has since gripped their homeland. Natural survivalists and efficient trackers, they unexpectedly flourished in the Dark Days while the other races suffered. Brought into the world by a young hero, the Oryan Ceutei culture remains fairly isolated and tribal, however throughout history they made great steps in unifying the naturalistic cultures of Orya against the growing destruction of industry.
				</p>

		</div>
		<div class="info-sub1" id="Abalnairu">
			<h3><a title="Abalnairu" href="Beasts/Abalnairu/">Abalnairu</a></h3>

			<p>
			An ancient race of buglike humanoids, the wise folk of central Abaln's clans have hardy constitutions made for traveling long distances without rest. Once the builders of the world's first great cities, the Abalnairu were forced into nomadicism by terrible magics that leveled their lands. At home in Abaln and Orya’s great deserts, they have domesticated Qalrocs as their traveling homes. Abalnairu make for deft guides, capable warriors, and shrewd merchants. 
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div id="Humanity">
		<h2>Humanity</h2>

		<p>
		Sons and daughters of the Titan Sollus, Humanity were killing machines until Ergor's magic brought about the Sundering. Since the First Age, Humanity’s history stretches across a rich lineage of great empires; founded on the tenants of justice, liberty, and equality--for man. While their war of destruction may be ancient history, the scars on both sides run deep…
		</p>

		<div class="info-sub1" id="Thunderkin">
			<h3><a href="Humanity/Thunderkin/">Thunderkin</a></h3>

			<p>
			The Thunderkin are the First Folk, brought to Illia by Sollus himself in a war of total desolation. Each was made in an aspect of the divine, and their kind may represent Wind, Fire, Earth, and Water. Each subspecies of Thunderkin has distinct physical and cultural features, and the magical genes of their females are exceptionally dominant. The Thunderkin have never adhered to many ideals of democracy, instead they tend to believe that might makes right.
			</p>
			<div class="info-sub2">
				<h4><a href="Humanity/Thunderkin/index.html#Novani/">Novani</a></h4>

				<p>
				The proud descendants of the “First Empire,” Novani are large, boisterous individuals with a strong sense of honor and loyalty. Sons and daughters of the mountainous Thunder Isles, the Novani are a pale race without traditional gender roles and--unlike their cousins--they have had their fair share of kings and emperors. Novani are naturally open-minded, however their ancient conflict with the Quosh’ari Dominion has left many with unfriendly impressions of the Dominion’s inheritors.
				</p>

				<h4><a href="Humanity/Thunderkin/index.html#Rumani">Rumani</a></h4>

				<p>
				Enigmatic dark-skinned masters of energy magic, the Rumani have adopted a strict theocratic society in which the powerful are worshipped and the weak know their place. An incredibly insular culture, few outsiders have seen their grand temple-cities in person. With a notorious reputation for human sacrifice, few have the desire to. Mistrusting of other races, Rumani generally travel alone, but often find themselves in positions of power abroad.
				</p>

				<h4><a href="Humanity/Thunderkin/Abalni/index.html#Abalni">Abalni</a></h4>

				<p>
				Amicable masters of healing magics; these peaceful nomads are stocky and bronze-toned, with a fine-tuned mindset for craftsmanship. Friendly, and trusting to a fault, the Abalni spent much of their history as slaves or servants to their more violent cousins. While it was always believed that their culture was isolated to the mountains of their namesake continent, the Abalni have settled across much of the known world.
				</p>

				<h4><a href="Humanity/Thunderkin/Durmari/index.html#Durmari">Durmari</a></h4>

				<p>
				Uncontested masters of the sea, the Durmari are a savage, bloodthirsty race possessing few minds of great value. However, those that defy the stereotypes surrounding their kind are infamous maegi, admirals, and Sealords. The Durmari can be found anywhere the sea can be smelled, and the more civilized members of the race find employment as sailors, merchants, and marines.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="info-sub1" id="Quosh'ari">
			<h3><a href="Humanity/Quosh'ari/">Quosh'ari</a></h3>

			<p>
			Founders of the largest empire in history, Quosh'ari are pragmatic and exploitative, with a passion for law, math, and education. Always playing the 'shadow of their past self,' the Quosh'ari remain proud to a fault. Shrewd merchants and frequently brilliant minds, they have enjoyed golden ages and endured dark times. Despite the hollowing of their Dominion, the Quosh'ari can be found in every corner of Illia’s civilization, and quite often in the wilderness as well.
			</p>
			<div class="info-sub2">
				<h4><a href="Humanity/Quosh'ari/index.html#True_Quosh'ari">True Quosh'ari</a></h4>

				<p>
				The descendants of the Dominion, Quosh'ari inhabit the birthplace of their culture--Shar. Remaining loyal to the unbroken line of emperors, Quosh'ari are often disdainful of the other races of man, in particular the former members of the Dominion. Adept magic users, Quosh'ari are poor martial fighters but have always kept a firm grasp on their own lands.
				</p>

				<h4><a href="Humanity/Quosh'ari/index.html#Quosh">Quosh</a></h4>

				<p>
				Rebelling from the Dominion during its recession, the Quosh are not a kingdom but rather a cultural identity. Inhabiting Abaln, Novanos, and small portions of western Orya, Quosh are simple folk that rarely have the ambition of their Quosh'ari cousins. Rejecting the Dominion's obsession with legality, Quosh are often hardy folk that have an intense spiritual connection with Illia, expressed through worship of a variety of animalistic deities often referred to as the Nine Lords.
				</p>

				<h4><a href="Humanity/Quosh'ari/index.html#Quoryan">Quoryan</a></h4>

				<p>
				The remnants of the Dominion's significant expansion, Quoryans are a collection of small kingdoms and city-states that still swear allegiance to the Emperor, but have no de facto connections to what remains of Quosh'ari culture. Inhabiting the southern shelf of the Oryan continent, Quoryans are often nomadic. Able horsemen and strong warriors by necessity, Quoryans are far less civilized than their cousins within the Dominion.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="info-sub1" id="Syrn">
			<h3><a href="Humanity/Syrn/">Syrn</a></h3>

			<p>
			Named for the continent of their cultural Oryan, the Syrnians were originally Rumani Thunderkin. During the Rift, Syrn became isolated from the Thunder Isles, and the Syrnians were forever changed by the horrible winter. Many of them fled underground into great cave-cities, and their centuries spent beneath the frost turned their flesh to ash. When Syrn rose from the depths of their mountain home, they took the world by storm.
			</p>
			<div class="info-sub2">
				<h4><a href="Humanity/Syrn/index.html#Imperial">Imperial</a></h4>

				<p>
				“Sons of Calner,” Imperial Syrnians are a hardy race of short stature. Passionate fighters and thinkers with an intense - often unwavering - sense of solidarity. Syrnian culture was lost in centuries of tribal warfare before Calner Steelsoul unified them under one banner. Under his leadership, the Syrnian Empire came to dominate much of the civilized world in the Second Age of Man--brought only to heel by its own pride. Founders of the Steamcult, an unforgiving, militaristic religion that knows no god but Syrn.
				</p>

				<h4><a href="Humanity/Syrn/index.html#Walmer">Walmer</a></h4>

				<p>
				"Those That Survived the Storm," Walmer are the Syrnians that were not fortunate enough to be allowed underground. Slightly larger than their Imperial cousins, the Walmer were long been subjected to Imperial rule. Competent fighters with unfathomable camarederie, the Walmer value strength above all else. The Walmer were once the dominant cultural identity on the Syrnian continent, however they were no match for fledgling Imperial strategy and were forced into assimilation. After the collapse of the empire, Walmer and Imperial Syrnians generally view each other as equals, but have always seen all others as lesser beings.

		<div class="info-sub1" id="Simaal'i'Lima">
			<h3><a href="Humanity/Simaal'i'Lima/">Simaali'Lima</a></h3>

			<p>
			Since the <a href="../History/The_Sundering_of_Man/" title="Sundering of Man" class="file">Sundering of Man</a>, the peoples of Lima were long a myriad of insular, isolated, and humble tribes inhabiting Orya’s southern shelf. Joined by the beached Durmari known as the Simaal'i, they developed into a flourishing culture of artistic and mathematic expression. Subjugated to the rule of Principality after Dominion after Empire, they are no strangers to irregular warfare. Maintaining a loose cultural identity, the heartland of Illia has long been a hotbed of war, thought, and faith.
			</p>
			<div class="info-sub2">
				<h4><a href="Humanity/Simaal'i'Lima/index.html#Limanu">Limanu</a></h4>

				<p>
				Proud tribal nomads hailing from Orya's central steppe. Descended from Novani settlers during the days of the First Empire, the Limanu are quick, sturdy, and dependable. Credited with the domestication of horses, the Limanu share a deep spiritual bond with the native beasts of Lima. Suffering a series of brutal defeats to Syrn in the Second Age of Man, the Limanu faded into obscurity.
				</p>

				<h4><a href="Humanity/Simaal'i'Lima/index.html#Simaal'i">Simaal'i</a></h4>

				<p>
				Resourceful thinkers and masterful strategists—on and off the battlefield. The descendents of Durmari whose home went dry, the Simaal'i are well-accustomed to both land and sea. Founded by a cabal of endlessly curious polymaths, the Simaal'i Caliphate's legacy is stained by countless years of religious conflict. While Simaa'li thinkers are credited with a number of technological advancements throughout history, their culture largely descended into religious xenophobism in the days after their defeat to the Principality.
				</p>

		</div>				

		<div class="info-sub1" id="Hemos">
			<h3><a href="Humanity/Hemos/">Hemos</a></h3>

			<p>
			Founders of a mighty, magical empire in southern Orya, the Hemosi are descendants of the Rumani and Abalni that chose to travel eastward after the Sundering of Man. Unlike the other races of Humanity, Hemosi welcomed Beasts and Ergor into their culture, and for ages lived in peace with nature. Their last king cursed them in an attempt to stave off Syrnian invasion in the Second Age of Man, and they soon faded into the mists of time.

	<div id="Virals">
		<h2>Virals</h2>

		<p>
		Born from the very essence of the Titan's cosmic war, the Viralminds are two distinct species of aggressive microscopic lifeforms exhibiting hivemind intelligence. Viralminds are particularly aggressive towards the other sentient species of Illia, however their methods of aggression bear little resemblence.
